# GOLEM

GOLEM (Gene regulatOry eLEMents) enables users to precisely locate any motif of interest with respect to TSS or ATG within the relevant plant genomes across the plant Tree of Life (_Marchantia_, _Physcomitrium_, _Amborella_, _Oryza_, _Zea_, _Solanum_ and _Arabidopsis_). The visualisation of the motifs is performed with respect to the transcript levels of particular genes in leaves and male reproductive tissues, and can be compared with genome-wide distribution regardless of the transcription level

## GOLEM pipeline and UI

This repository contains the GOLEM data pipeline and the GOLEM UI.

Hosted version of GOLEM can be found at [golem.ncbr.muni.cz](https://golem.ncbr.muni.cz)

The project consists of two parts:

- [GOLEM data pipeline](/pipeline/README.md)
- [GOLEM UI](/ui/README.md)
